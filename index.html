            <p>The rapid advancement in science and technology around the globe produced the maximum demand of quality
                graduates in Computer Science and Engineering. To maintain the pace with this burgeoning arena of
                computer science and engineering, it is becoming an important discipline of engineering studies.
                Now-a-days it has become our responsibility to develop human resource in this area with the initiative
                taken by both public and private sectors.

                Objective and Goal

                Founded in 2003, the Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) Department of GUB continues to lead the nation
                in research and education with a clear objective to produce quality graduates. A combination of highly
                qualified faculty members and state-of-the-art facilities are in the process of establishing the
                department as one of the leading and prestigious CSE departments of the country. The competency of the
                department should be evident from the achievement of the alumni. The CSE department is working heart and
                soul to create a brand value both in industrial and academic sectors in home and abroad.

                Bachelor of Science degree requires one student to undergo several fundamental and core courses of this
                arena. And to keep pace with the state-of-the-art research some advanced courses are also included in
                the undergraduate program. Apart from these courses, one needs to study the interdisciplinary courses
                which are equally important for the graduates in any discipline. In the final year, one student should
                focus on a particular area to conduct a Thesis/Project which will test abilities to maximum and to
                provide the best blend of technical knowledge and professional guidance. Additionally there will be a
                good number of short courses, seminars and academic contests during the regular study period.</p>
